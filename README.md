Config files, plugins and extras commonly used to hack on emacs.
Tested (and created for) Emacs 29 (with X).

Notes about previous versions:
NOTE 1: In the original version all plugins was included in this repo. Now it uses use-package to download the packages as needed.
NOTE 2: Up to tag "single-env" there was a single config for Python, Rust and general. Now I'm testing having independent homes. See "suggested-aliases".

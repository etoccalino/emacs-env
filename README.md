Config files, plugins and extras commonly used to hack on emacs.
Tested (and created for) Emacs 30 (without X).

REMEMBER to review the header notes for the system dependecies and set up instructions.

Notes about previous versions:

Changelog NOTE 1: In the original version all plugins was included in this repo. Now it uses use-package to download the packages as needed.
Changelog NOTE 2: Up to tag "single-env" there was a single config for Python, Rust and general. Now I'm testing having independent homes. See "suggested-aliases".
Changelog NOTE 3: I ended up scrapping the multi-language configs and dirs. Using VSCode for coding and emacs for touch ups and everything else, so went back to single .emacs and .emacs.d
